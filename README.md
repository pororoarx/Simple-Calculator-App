# Simple-Calculator-App

A Python Script that functions as a simple calculator. It prompts the user to choose a basic mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), input two numbers, and displays the output. It also offers users the option to try again or exit. It implements Python functions and exceptions to handle different errors.

•	Installation
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine: ‘git clone git@github.com:pororoarx/Simple-Calculator-App.git’

•	Usage
1.	Open Git Bash and go to the project directory.
2.	Run the program: ‘calculator.py’
3.	 The program will display a welcome message. It will ask to user to input the corresponding number of the operation they will use. (1 – Addition; 2- Subtraction; 3- Multiplication; 4- Division)
4.	The program will always ask user to input two numbers, no matter what operation the user has chosen.
5.	After the user has entered two numbers, the program will execute the respective operation and display the result.
6.	If the user enters an invalid input at any point, such as invalid input of operation number or non-numeric number, the program will display an error message and ask the user if they want to try again or not.
7.	After the display of the results, the program will ask the user again if they want to perform another calculation.
8.	If the user enters ‘YES’, it will perform another calculation. If its ‘NO’, the program will exit the program
9.	If another calculation is requested, the user will be asked again to enter new preferred operation and enter two numbers again.
10.	If the user chooses to exit, the program will display a “Thank you!” message and terminate.

•	Formulation
1. This program was formulated using Python. It defined a function to modularized various parts of the code. It also uses a while loop to allow user to repeatedly prompt an input and perform mathematical operations until the user chooses to exit the program. It also uses the Python’s try-except feature to handle potential errors that will be made from the user’s invalid responses, such as invalid inputs or division by error, by printing a simple error message to the user instead. It also incorporates different color formatting to enhance readability of the output in the terminal. 

•	Conclusion
1. This Simple Calculator App is a program designed to perform basic mathematical operations by keeping in mind to have a user-friendly command-line interface. It is designed to ensure users for accurate results and proper error handling. It is a simple program that users can use to add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers entered. It is also a program that allows for basic repetition calculations.
